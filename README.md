# reduced-host-information
Originally a separate project, the reduced-host-information repository builds on the functionality of the original host-information repository while also adding modularity for ease of modification in the future. The reduced_host_information.py is a run-all terminal program that allows for the user to pull either all host information or a reduced amount of host information from the Ansible Tower API. The information from the CSV can be parsed for different attributes to be used at the owners disgression.
